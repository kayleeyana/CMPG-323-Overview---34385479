PROJECT 1: Overview
### Welcome to the CMPG-323 semester projects overview.
###
This overview provides an outline of the structure and strategies for the CMPG-323 semester projects.

###

# PROJECT SUBMISSIONS AND REPOSITORIES
Each project submission will consist of separate repositories, each with a specific focus:
###
Project 2:
Repository Name: API Development
###

Project 3:
Repository Name: Patterns and Standards
###

Project 4:
Repository Name: Testing and RPA
###

Project 5:
Repository Name: Reporting and Monitoring
###

Portfolio of Evidence:

# PROJECT STRUCTURE
The diagram below provides a visual representation of the structure of each project submission and its corresponding repository name.

# BRANCHING STRATEGY:
The chosen approach for the branching strategy in each project will involve primarily working within the main branch. However, in the event of a bug occurrence, a dedicated development branch will be created specifically to address and resolve the issue.

###
# .gitignore USAGE:
To maintain a clean repository, each project submission will include a .gitignore file. This file will exclude sensitive data from being tracked and committed, ensuring that only relevant and non-sensitive information is shared.

###
###

# SECURITY:
To ensure security, sensitive credentials, and confidential information will be stored within files explicitly excluded from public visibility. This method guarantees that private data remains safeguarded and inaccessible when the repository is accessible to the public.

###
# CHARTS

###
###

I developed the Burndown chart by initially compiling a comprehensive list of tasks extracted from the linked assessment view. Each task was assigned to its corresponding category, and I calculated the total workload for each category. This aggregation of tasks formed the basis for the Burndown chart creation.

The Burndown chart was structured around multiple sprints, each representing a distinct phase of work. As we progressed through the project over the course of the semester, the aim is to observe a gradual reduction in the number of tasks remaining within each sprint.

As the sprints unfolded and tasks are successfully completed and would be checked off, the overall task count for each sprint would be expected to decrease incrementally. This visual representation allows us to track our progress and provided a clear indication of how effectively I am managing and completing tasks as the semester advances.
