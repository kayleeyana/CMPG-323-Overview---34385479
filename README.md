BRANCHING STRATEGY:
The chosen approach for the branching strategy in each project will involve primarily working within the main branch. However, in the event of a bug occurrence, a dedicated development branch will be created specifically to address and resolve the issue.

.gitignore USAGE:
The gitIgnore will be used for each project submission, and this is to prevent sensitive data from being tracked. 

SECURITY:
Sensitive credentials and confidential information will be housed within files designed to be excluded from public visibility. This approach guarantees that private data remains protected and inaccessible when the repository is made available to the public.
